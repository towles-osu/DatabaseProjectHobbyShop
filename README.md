# DatabaseProjectHobbyShop
Repository for Matthew and Stew's cs340 project

The database backend is shut-down because the term ended, but this repository contains a basic database backend and frontend.
Implemented using nodejs and express for server communication (as well as mySQL for the database itself, originally setup on MariaDB).

When reviving make sure to update the dbcon.js file to reflect the new database info.
