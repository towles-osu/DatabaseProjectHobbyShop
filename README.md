# DatabaseProjectHobbyShop
Repository for Matthew and Stew's cs340 project

The database backend is shut-down because the term ended, but this repository contains a basic database backend and frontend.
Implemented using nodejs and express for server communication (as well as mySQL for the database itself, originally setup on MariaDB).
